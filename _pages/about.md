# About me
------

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Robot Perception Lab, supervised by Prof. [Shan Luo](https://shanluo.github.io/).  I am passionate about endowing robots with generalizable, explainable tactile sensing abilities like humans. In my Ph.D., I mainly focus on addressing challenges in vision-based tactile sensors and contact-rich robot grasping/manipulation tasks with learning-based methods. Before starting my Ph.D., I have three years of experience in simulation, fabrication, and verification of flexible tactile sensors.
